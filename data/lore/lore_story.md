# The Veilborn Chronicle (Lore Pack v1)

This lore is designed to be discovered in fragments: graves, wall tablets, ruined workshops, half-collapsed hubs, and the quiet, stubborn villages of the **Hearthward Covenant**. Nothing here is required to “beat” the game—it's a thread the player can tug on whenever they want.

## The First Truth: There Was a Pattern

The world you wake into is **the Root**—the “first layer,” the one that holds the weight of everything else.

Long before you, the **Ancient Architects** discovered a simple rule that shows up again and again in their inscriptions:


### The Nullrock Layer (known as Corestone in old records)

At the deepest point of Caelum Prime, the stone changes. It stops behaving like material and starts behaving like a rule.

The Ancients called it **Nullrock**—the world’s *last line*, hammered into the Root so pressure from other agreements has somewhere to end.  
Some old tools and maps still label it **Corestone**. That is the same layer, just a lesser name.

Nullrock cannot be mined, melted, or imprinted. Magic dulls near it, not because Nullrock is strong, but because it is **final**.

> “The world must end cleanly, or it will end on its own.”

### Common Materials of Caelum Prime

Not every craft touches the Veil. Most of life is built on ordinary, reliable stuff—then made *deliberate*.

- **Coal (Embercoal):** safer heat for forges and lamps; preferred near thin places.
- **Iron (Anchor-iron):** the honest metal used for frames, clamps, and “things that must hold.”
- **Gold (Sunmetal):** a soft metal that carries alignment cleanly; used in conductors and fine inlays.
- **Diamond (Facetstone):** used to etch and cut; keystones and tuning marks are often diamond-scored.
- **Crafting Table:** the first altar of civilization—where scraps become shapes.

> **Frame. Conduit. Limiter.**  
> A thing that touches the Veil must have all three, or it will bite back.

They weren’t wrong. They also weren’t careful.

## Dimensions (Limited Set for v1)

For now, the player will hear of only **two** other reachable realms. They leak subtly before travel is possible.

### 1) The Cinderfold
A hot, ember-bright fold of reality where heat behaves like a living animal.  
**Leak signs:** warm gusts underground, faint soot on stone, “spark-drift” particles at thin-spots.

### 2) The Veilsea
A pale, misted expanse where water hangs in the air and distance lies.  
**Leak signs:** dew on blocks that should be dry, distant whispers, shimmer halos around glass.

> **Important:** These realms are **not always “there.”**  
> The Architects learned that “a dimension” is closer to a *frequency* than a place.

## The Factions

### The Continuists (The Builders)
They believed the Veil could be measured, stabilized, and made practical.
- Built workshops, hubs, early gates.
- Left the most useful notes: measurements, warnings, rules.
- Their pride created the first large-scale accidents.

**Symbol:** the **Three-Part Knot** (Frame/Conduit/Limiter).  
**Typical sites:** ruined workshops, portal foundations, broken hubs.

### The Veilkeepers (The Sealers)
They believed the Veil is a wound in the world, and every “hole” must be stitched shut.
- Built **Seals** and **Regulators**.
- Wrote in warnings and prohibitions.
- Some of their rituals are effective; some are superstition dressed as math.

**Symbol:** a **closed eye** inside a circle.  
**Typical sites:** sealed chambers, cave shrines, thin-spot markers.

### The Ascendants (The Ladder)
They believed other realms are proof the Root is only the first rung.
- Pursued “purification” through travel and transformation.
- Some succeeded (briefly). Most vanished.
- Their inscriptions are poetic and infuriatingly vague.

**Symbol:** a **vertical stair** of three steps.  
**Typical sites:** high ridges, cliff monuments, sky-facing plinths.

### The Echo Faith (The Choir)
They believed the Veil is not empty. It *listens.*
- Interpreted anomalies as messages.
- Spread practices that “invite” responses.
- Some of their beliefs are false… until they aren’t.

**Symbol:** a **split circle** like a mouth.  
**Typical sites:** small shrines, caches, places where corruption is thickest.

### The Hearthward Covenant (The Survivors)
They are the only organized group that endured the collapse.
- They don’t chase gates. They **endure** them.
- Their villages are small, quiet, and wary.
- NPCs **hint** rather than teach: they trade fragments, tools, and materials later, but they rarely explain everything.

**Symbol:** a **single flame** under a roofline.  
**Typical sites:** small towns near rivers/roads, with simple signposts and ward-stones.

## The Architects’ Failures: Corruption and the Changed

Not every monster is “born.” Some are **made**.

### The Changed (Corrupted People)
When someone forces Veil-work without the full Pattern, the world doesn’t explode—  
it **rewrites the person** to fit the gap.

The Continuists called it **Misalignment**. The Echo Faith called it **Blessing**.  
The Hearthward call it simply: **the Change**.

**How it happens (lore rule):**
- A portal built with a hungry Limiter.
- A staff bound with an Echo catalyst.
- A regulator assembled without a proper anchor.

The result is a creature that remembers *enough* to hate you.

### The Undead (The Root-Empty)
Undead are different: they are a **death condition**, not a crafting mistake.

When someone dies **while the Veil is thin** (near a leaking site, on a Sealstone, in a saturated Echo field),
the Root fails to “close the book.” The body rises as a **Root-Empty**.

Later, the player will be able to replicate this by dying in specific conditions (optional, never required).

## Magic: The Staff-Work

Magic exists, but it’s not “free.” It’s **patterned pressure**.

Staffs don’t create elements from nothing. They **shape** what leaks through:
- Cinderfold pressure becomes flame.
- Veilsea pressure becomes lift, mist, and resistance.

### The Easy Rule (So the player never feels dumb)
Every staff recipe is readable as:
1. **Handle** (Wood)
2. **Conduit** (Dust/Crystal/Core)
3. **Limiter** (a Sigil that decides if it’s steady or hungry)

The player can always build a working staff in the **safe** way.
The “bad” way always works too—but adds corruption/anomalies instead of failing.

## Enchanting: The Runic Anvil

The Runic Anvil doesn’t “add stats.”  
It **binds a story** to an item, and the item behaves accordingly.

- **Safe catalysts** (Axiom, Crystal, Alloy) bind cleanly.
- **Unstable catalysts** (Echo, Bloom, Sealstone) bind eagerly and leave residue.

## Potions: The Quiet Alembic

Potions are temporary agreements with the Veil:
- You offer it a pattern (herbs + salts).
- It lends you a trait (speed, jump, resistance).

Even unstable brews should never be “hard fails.”  
They always do the thing, but may also add a drawback (thinness, corruption tick, attention).

## The Gates: Portals and Networks

### World Gates (Dimension Travel)
A World Gate is an arch of **Waybound Frame** blocks, awakened by:
- an **Attuned Keystone** (the “address”),
- a **Timed Limiter** (the “valve”),
- and an **Evergate Core** (the “heartbeat”).

**Lore promise:** once stabilized, a gate can remain open indefinitely until the player closes it.

### Waygates (Fast Travel Network)
Waygates are not dimension doors. They are **shortcuts through the Root**.
The Architects built networks of plinths and regulators so they could move supplies without traveling.

- A **Waygate Plinth** is the node.
- A **Transit Regulator** is the brain.
- A **Waygate Rune** is the address.

Network lore strongly implies the Continuists and Veilkeepers fought here:
the Builders wanted speed; the Sealers wanted fewer holes.

## How the Player Learns All This (Inscriptions & Fragments)

The player will find:
- **Graves**: short, human notes, regrets, warnings.
- **Wall tablets**: measurements, recipes, faction disputes.
- **Recipe fragments**: partial steps that unlock “blueprints” in the player’s journal later.

**Key design goal:** nothing reads like a textbook. Everything reads like survivors writing for survivors.

# Practical Content: Names, Blocks, and the Two-Path Rule

All craftable things in this pack have:
- **One steady (safe) recipe**
- **One hungry (unstable) recipe**

Unstable recipes **never** hard-fail. They:
- raise corruption,
- increase anomaly pressure,
- or cause subtle world effects (leaks, Echo attention).

The actual structured recipes are in:
- `Assets/data/lore/recipes_structured.json`

Block / item identifiers are written to match RedactedCraft’s current **BlockId**-as-inventory system.
